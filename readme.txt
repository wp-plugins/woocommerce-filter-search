Change the search query behaviour searching only in the post/product title.

== Description ==

Change the search query behaviour searching only in the post/product title. You can add post types to the **not allowed** list using [this code](https://gist.github.com/SiR-DanieL/8ca1b1b33ab791836a59).

By default the unallowed post types are **product** and **shop_webhook**.

**NOTE**: This plugin will always search for products, but the keyword will be compared **only** with the product title.

= Usage =

Just activate the plugin.

= Support =
For any support request, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/PinchOfCode/woocommerce-filter-search/issues).

**Note**: since the free nature of this plugin, the support may be discontinuous, but all the requests are checked and replied. We suggest to write on [GitHub](https://github.com/PinchOfCode/woocommerce-filter-search/issues) to get faster support.
